# First,I want to say thanks to my IOT's teacher,so i wrote a poem to show how I appreciate him

#  Poem:
#  Oh! Ke , You have a good figure.
#  I admit that I started to notice you because you were good-looking.
#  You are bright, personable and resourceful.
#  You are the most graceful bearing of the boys I have ever met.
#  You are a tough guy who fears nothing and no one.I feel secure and protected whenI am with you.
